# ToyRISC Processor Simulator 

* _lab1_ - Some programs written in _ToyRISC_ (used as benchmarks in the next few labs)
* _lab2_ - An assembler for the _ToyRISC_ ISA
* _lab3_ - A single cycle processor simulator for _ToyRISC_
* _lab4_ - Updating to a 5 stage pipelined core model
* _lab5_ - Upgrading _lab4_ to a discrete event simulator
* _lab6_ - Added caches to the simulated memory system


This was part of the course CS2160 - Computer Organisation Lab offered by Indian Institute of Technology, Palakkad.
